They can hire and fire almost at will, often opting for the most cost-effective option, such as temporary contracts. A prime example is the widespread use of temping. In the UK, it's common for workers to remain 'temps' for months or even years, often employed through agencies that don't grant them the same rights as permanent staff. Companies exploit this loophole to avoid offering full employment benefits. In contrast, many other countries limit temporary contracts to around three months, after which employers must decide to hire or release the worker.

Why is it that in this country workers can be kept on as 'temps' for months, years, even? Temps who work through agencies don't have the same rights as company employees and this is why the company chooses to hire them this way. A union would probably have the powers to do something about this.

Furthermore, legalisation might discourage innovation and professional content creation if creators cannot expect their rights to be protected. That said, I recognise that the current system is not perfect. High costs, restrictive licensing, and lack of access in some regions do make piracy a tempting alternative for many people.

However, the amount must be carefully calibrated to avoid disrupting market mechanisms. If businesses face excessive labor costs, they will inevitably raise prices, reduce competitiveness, and potentially relocate operations abroad, ultimately destroying the jobs UBI aims to protect. 

More critically, UBI should complement rather than replace wage differentials that reflect skill and responsibility. Currently, NHS healthcare assistants with demanding, high-responsibility roles earn similar wages to supermarket cashiers, creating a troubling exodus from essential public services toward less stressful retail work.

This stops workers from being extorted and being taken advantage of. However this basic wage should not be so high that it starts to affect the free market economy. For example, if a coffee shop chain has to pay large amounts to it's staff, the cost of it's goods and services will have to rise, resulting in less people spending with them. Ultimately the company closes or moves to another country. Jobs are lost and the economy suffers.
Also I feel strongly that someone working in Tesco, beeping orders at a checkout should be paid significantly less than say, a health care assistant on a busy hospital ward and has much more responsibility. At the moment, people are leaving these types of NHS jobs because they are too stressful and demanding. Instead they can be paid the same hourly rate of pay in a supermarket. This is not right.

While maintaining a fish differs significantly from dog ownership, both deserve proper care.

Current pet acquisition systems lack adequate safeguards, allowing anyone to purchase animals from stores without background checks, licenses, or mandatory registration. Point-of-sale protocols should emphasize the gravity of adopting a living being and ensure buyers understand their lifelong responsibilities.

Second, feminism is a broad and contested movement—who gets to define which perspectives are included? This could lead to bias or exclusion of diverse viewpoints. Third, literature’s value lies in its artistic and humanistic qualities, not its adherence to any particular ideology. Great works resonate because they explore universal themes of love, conflict, and identity, not because they align with political agendas.

Without proper safeguards, decriminalisation may exacerbate these issues rather than protect sex workers. While some argue that legalisation could improve safety and regulation, the potential for abuse and criminal involvement makes me cautious.

The UK’s foreign policy should be adaptable and grounded in current global realities, considering both longstanding relationships and emerging opportunities. Commonwealth connections can offer unique advantages, such as shared language, legal systems, and institutional frameworks, but focusing exclusively on these could limit the UK’s strategic flexibility. At the same time, forming partnerships with non-Commonwealth countries may bring innovative collaborations and access to new markets that are vital to the UK’s evolving interests. Striking a balance—valuing Commonwealth ties without sidelining prospects with other global players—seems to be the most pragmatic path forward.

Disabled students face unique challenges and barriers that require additional support and resources to ensure they have equal access to educational opportunities. Rather than reducing funding, these students actually need extra financial support to cover specialized equipment, assistive technologies, additional teaching support, and accessible facilities that enable them to participate fully in their education.

Ultimately our society benefits from having disabled people who are able to study and gain workplace skills which will help them to find employment, rather than have them existing on benefits.

On one hand, drones are cheaper and more resourceful than traditional methods, offering precision strikes and reduced risk to soldiers. They can be vital for intelligence gathering and minimizing collateral damage in conflict zones. On the other hand, there are valid concerns about the ethical implications of drone warfare, including civilian casualties and the potential for misuse. Both arguments hold merit: while drones enhance military efficiency and safety, they also raise moral questions about warfare’s evolving nature. Striking a balance between leveraging their advantages and addressing their risks is crucial. A ban might limit the UK’s defensive capabilities, but stricter regulations could mitigate harm.

Charging an electric car from a window or across a pavement poses safety risks to pedestrians and is not a viable long-term solution. Installing public charging points along streets every 15–20 feet would be logistically challenging and prohibitively expensive in such a short timeframe. It’s unclear who would bear the cost of this upgrade, especially as local councils are already financially strained and any attempt to raise council tax to fund it would be politically unpopular.

- The UK power grid is already under pressure and is unlikely to handle the surge in demand caused by widespread electric vehicle charging during peak evening hours. Meeting this demand would require a significant increase in electricity production, a process that would take more than five years. The most realistic way to supply this energy would be through a major investment in nuclear power plants, which are expensive, time-consuming to build, and often opposed by local communities due to safety and environmental concerns.

The UK's experience with privatising other essential services provides compelling evidence against this approach, as we've witnessed significant failures in privatised water companies and rail services that consistently fail to meet public expectations. Private operators inevitably prioritise shareholder profits over service quality and public benefit, creating perverse incentives that could compromise prisoner welfare, staff safety, and rehabilitation programmes.

We only have to look at the poor state of our water supply and rail services across the country since privatisation. Not enough money is invested in services to keep them fit for purpose.

Furthermore, this policy risks exacerbating existing wealth inequality, as affluent professionals in comfortable, well-compensated positions can more easily extend their careers, while manual laborers struggle with the physical demands.

The gender pay gap, for instance, appears more attributable to factors like career choices and work patterns than to systematic discrimination.

Restricting urban development might reduce housing supply, worsening affordability issues, especially in high-demand areas. A balanced approach is needed—one that increases housing availability through thoughtful urban planning while preserving rural landscapes. Forcing people to live farther from cities due to limited expansion could lead to longer commutes, increased traffic congestion, and higher pollution levels, undermining sustainability efforts. Instead of outright limits, policies should encourage efficient land use, such as denser, well-connected urban developments with green spaces.

First, it reduces the number of available homes, making it harder for people to find affordable places to live in cities. When fewer homes are built, the demand for houses stays high, which pushes up prices and rents. This makes housing less affordable, especially for low and middle class families. Additionally, if building is restricted near cities, people may be forced to move farther away.

The lasting negative impacts of colonialism on former colonies are undeniable, including economic exploitation, political instability, and social disruption in some parts of the world.

Vaccines play a crucial role in stopping the virus from spreading, especially to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. When more people are vaccinated, the overall risk of transmission decreases, making communities safer for everyone. Vaccination is not just a personal health decision; it's a social responsibility that demonstrates care and solidarity during a global crisis.

One concern is the potential loss of jobs. Many people are employed in this sector, and a phase-out could negatively affect those who have spent years training and working in the industry. Additionally, nuclear energy is a relatively reliable source, and switching entirely to renewables could pose some risks in terms of energy stability.

Still, I support the idea overall and think it would benefit the UK if nuclear power were reduced rather than eliminated entirely. A key advantage is the positive environmental impact—less radioactive waste and fewer harmful emissions would result. Moreover, this shift would encourage increased use of renewable sources like wind and solar energy.

Firstly, without social media, kids will be forced to use other avenues to socialise with their peers, reducing their reliance on instagram, and other social media platforms that allow them to skirt away from face to face interactions. In the digital age, and the rise in social media usage by the younger generations, has started having an impact on their social skills when face to face, and this is most likley in part due to their over reliance to use text based, emoji based communications rather than speak face to face or even via voice calls. reducing text based messaging and 'tiktok/reel' based communication could have a positive impact on their ability to express themselves and carry themselves in social situations. 

Secondly, removing socialmedia will prevent addiction cycles of doom scrolling and endless dopamine releases from just watching reels continuously. Which will be good for their brains and development.

When armed forces no longer risk lives, the threshold for initiating conflict lowers, potentially leading to more frequent and reckless use of military force. Additionally, such a ban is crucial to setting a global precedent; if the UK takes a stand, other nations may follow, reducing the widespread adoption of drone warfare.

The aim is to promote unity through increased awareness. However, you cannot mandate genuine empathy through legal requirements. This brings me to my next point: such training often breeds resentment between groups, rather than nurturing mutual respect. True compassion must be cultivated through positive emotions and organic experiences, not imposed rules. Mandatory inclusion training can feel like being told, “You will care after doing this tedious task,” which often leads to negative reactions instead of positive growth.

Furthermore, many people treat it as a mere checkbox exercise—something to sit through rather than engage with meaningfully. As a result, it neither promotes understanding nor changes behavior. Often, it subconsciously reinforces division or disengagement. A more effective approach is leading by example. For instance, when Mohamed Salah played for Liverpool FC, data showed a noticeable decline in Islamophobic and anti-Middle Eastern sentiment, illustrating how visibility and personal connection can subtly but powerfully shift attitudes.",model,20.5,74.5,71.0,71.0,91.0,86.0,76.5,65.0,52.0,56.5,42.5,69.5,44.5,30-39,Male,White,Expert,Yes,Undergraduate degree,"£35,000-£49,999",Labour,Centrist

The goal is to build compassion and understanding between different people in hopes it helps create unity. You cannot do that by legally mandating someone to be compassionate. This leads me onto my second point(technically third point), all it does is create resentment between groups rather than allowing for a nurturing understanding bteween them. In order to have compassion, and understanding you have to nurture it with love and positive emotions, the concept of a forced and mandatory diversity training and inclusion is akin to saying ""you will love me after you do this really annoying thing"" rather than have a good impact it has a negative one instead. 

Lastly, people will and do treat it as a simple checkbox exercise, that they need to complete, people don't really pay attention and just want to get it over with.

While I understand the potential benefits of increased competition and lower drug prices, I believe the current regulatory framework serves crucial safety purposes that shouldn't be compromised. The rigorous approval processes and quality controls help ensure that medications meet safety and efficacy standards, protecting patients from potentially harmful or ineffective treatments. Weakening these safeguards could expose vulnerable populations to substandard drugs or create pathways for counterfeit medications to enter the supply chain.
